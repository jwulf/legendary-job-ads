# Senior Developer for the Prince of Darkness

Reporting directly to the CEO with dotted line reports to three senior VPs in distinct geos, you will be working in a tiny, cramped dark room in the sub-basement level of this condemned building. The office is situated next to a power generator and has a constant but varied background noise somewhere between 70db-90db. The temperature also fluctuates but does not fall below 30 degrees on the side of the office next to the powerplant. The other side of the office fluctuates between 25 and 6 degrees due to the industrial cold storage facility on the other side of the wall. 

Once you get this job, you will never see the light of day again, toiling from before sunrise to well after sunset. Your code will never see the light of day either.

You will be implementing feature requests provided by a committee of Business Analysts that is rotated every 4 - 8 weeks. At the end of each six-week sprint, your code is mercilessly critiqued in an eight-hour code review, then discarded. You will be provided with a new set of requirements that always contradict the immediately previous requirements and frequently each other, but also contain requirements that you actually implemented N-2 and N-3 sprints back, before they were removed.

On joining this organisation, you will be added to the ongoing class-action lawsuit brought against my client's organisation by users of their software. You will become a defendant and will be required to appear in court from time-to-time. Your manager will coach you extensively on what to say, but immediately before your appearance a company lawyer will warn you that you will be individually culpable for your testimony, and will force you to sign an affidavit absolving the company of all liability. Your manager will sit in the courtroom during your testimony and escort you back to the office immediately after.

You will also be provided with a copy of the 26-page terms of use agreement that users are required to sign, and will be required to sign this, at which point you will be added as a defendant to the counter-suit by the organisation against its users - as part of the company's software is the IDE that you will be using to develop further iterations of the software.

The core of the system is written in COBOL on an IBM mainframe. The front-end of the application uses whatever JavaScript Framework is tweeted out by @JavaScriptDaily between 8am and 11am AEST on Mondays. If several frameworks or libraries are featured, then all are used for that week.

The middle tier uses CORBA and SOAP on Windows 95 PCs that cannot be upgraded or replaced because of the custom serial interfaces that connect the mainframe to the internet. Between the 15 machines in this cluster, there are 3 kilometres of cabling.

There is no-one left alive in this dimension who knows how these machines work or exactly what they do - although some developers report that ghostly screams can be heard late at night from the CPUs. Documentation of this system is rumoured to exist somewhere, and to be written in a book bound by the skin of the developer who first implemented it. He is said to have gone insane while writing it, and flayed himself alive to complete the documentation - but also, everyone who has ever read the documentation has gone insane.

Your code must be audited by several government, non-goverment, para-government, and extra-governmental agencies before it can be approved for release. The total time for review is somewhere between 6 and 9 months.

To be considered for this position, you must have all ten fingers and ten toes intact. You also require the following:

1. A job
2. Social media savvy
3. Proof of performance
4. A brand identity system
5. A fan club
