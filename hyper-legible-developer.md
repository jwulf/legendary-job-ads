## Hyperlegible Developer for Big Browser-Blockchain Startup

Jump aboard this hype train, because it's about to leave the station!

If you are not browsing the web using Blockstack, developing Solidity contracts on Ethereum in your weekends, and mining on Nimiq in your browser _right now_, you are about to become as obsolete as the abacus - _in moments_!

Take it under advisement that this tech space is taking off and we'll be advertising for people with 3 - 5 years experience within the next six months, so double-down on it now and dominate this emerging niche.

For those who have already rocked, we salute you!

IBM Hyperledger is emerging as a front-runner in Blockchain technology for startups. We're working with no less than two start-ups using it; and we're looking for developers with experience developing on IBM Hyperledger Fabric.

These companies may well implode - after all, "the first guy through the door gets shot" as you'll hear one pundit say of early adopters in "_Banking on Bitcoin_", the Bitcoin documentary on Netflix.

However, your career will continue its meteoric rise from those ashes - like a Phoenix.

Alternatively, one of these companies could go to become the next billion-dollar company, in which case you'll be like that Dropbox employee #7 guy in Silicon Valley. 

Either way, you win.

Skills required:

* 5 years+ commercial software development experience
* Experience with the entire SLDC
* Test-driven development
* Experience in Agile software development
* Continuous Integration
* Experience in a Devops culture
* Distributed revision control 
* Experience with IBM Hyperledger, or another Blockchain technology
* Experience with two or more of the following languages: Java, Go, Node, Ruby, Lua

Bonus points if you have experience developing for Nginx Unit.

Both opportunities are located in the Brisbane CBD, with no option for remote work at this stage.
